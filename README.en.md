Work Review continuously records the apps you use, websites you visit, active windows, and screen context during the day, then turns those fragments into a **reviewable, queryable, and reusable** work trail.

- No manual check-ins
- Overview, timeline, daily report, and assistant all share the same local data
- You can jump from aggregate stats to concrete pages, titles, and screenshots
- Supports lightweight mode, Markdown report export, and multi-display screenshot strategies
- Includes `Desktop Avatar Beta` for lightweight presence feedback while you work

> All data stays local by default. AI features are optional.

## What It Is

This is not a traditional attendance app, and not just another dashboard that piles up time numbers.

Work Review is closer to a personal work-trace system:

- Capture work context automatically: apps, websites, screenshots, OCR text, and hourly summaries
- Answer practical questions: “What did I do today?” or “What has been the main focus this week?”
- Designed for recall and review, not surveillance

---

## Core Capabilities

### Automatic Tracking

| Dimension | Description |
|---------|------|
| App tracking | Detects the foreground app and records duration, titles, and categories |
| Website tracking | Captures browser URLs and aggregates by browser, domain, and page |
| Screen trail | Takes screenshots, extracts OCR text, and supports active-display or full-desktop capture |
| Idle detection | Uses both input and screen changes to reduce false working time |
| Historical replay | Reconstructs the day through a timeline with context |

### Analysis

| Capability | Description |
|-----|------|
| Work assistant | Answers questions based on your actual local records |
| Time-range understanding | Understands “yesterday”, “this week”, or “last 3 days” |
| Session grouping | Groups fragmented actions into longer work sessions |
| Todo extraction | Pulls likely follow-up items from pages, titles, and context |
| Daily report | Generates structured reports with history view and Markdown export |
| Dual response modes | Choose between stable templates and AI-enhanced output |
| Desktop Avatar Beta | Shows lightweight state feedback such as working, reading, meeting, music, video, and generating |

### Privacy

- Per-app `normal / anonymize / ignore`
- Sensitive keyword filtering
- Domain blacklist
- Pause on screen lock
- Manual pause / resume

### Control

- Lightweight mode: close the main window and keep only background tracking plus tray
- Reclassify app defaults directly from timeline details
- Migrate local data to another directory and clean old managed data afterward

## Screenshots

### Today Overview

<img src="docs/概览.png" alt="Work Review Overview" />

The overview page combines total duration, work duration, browser usage, website access, and app distribution in one place.

### Assistant

<img src="docs/助手.png" alt="Work Review Assistant" />

The assistant answers directly from your local records and is useful for recap, summaries, and todo extraction.

### Desktop Avatar Beta

The desktop avatar floats on the desktop and gives lightweight state feedback instead of acting as a full information panel.

---

## Pages

| Page | Purpose |
|------|-------|
| **Overview** | Aggregated totals, work duration, browser usage, websites, and app distribution |
| **Timeline** | Replay windows, screenshots, OCR, and visited pages by time |
| **Assistant** | Ask natural-language questions against your recorded work trail |
| **Report** | Generate, review, and export daily reports |
| **Settings** | Manage tracking, privacy, AI, avatar, lightweight mode, storage, and updates |

---

## AI

The core of Work Review is still **local recording**. AI is there to make those records easier to read, search, and review.

| Mode | Description |
|------|------|
| **Template** | Works out of the box with stable structured output |
| **AI Enhanced** | Uses your own model service for more natural summaries and answers |

Supported providers: Ollama, OpenAI-compatible APIs, DeepSeek, Qwen, Zhipu, Kimi, Doubao, SiliconFlow, Gemini, and Claude.
